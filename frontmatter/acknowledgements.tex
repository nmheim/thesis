\section*{Acknowledgements}%
\label{sec:acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to {\em eScience} and {\em TeamOcean}, my
two research groups at the University of Copenhagen. Their Professors {\em
Brian Vinter} and {\em Markus Jochum} have provided a stimulating,
collaborative environment for interesting research which I have highly
appreciated. Further I want to thank all the group members, that always had
an open ear for my countless questions and have had a great influence on this
thesis with their ideas and suggestions.  Especially, I want to thank {\em
James Avery} who has provided a tremendous amount of help, feedback, and
inspiration during the whole duration of this project without ever expecting
anything in return.\\

A big thank you also goes to all my friends who have read and re-read this
thesis and made suggestions for improvements. Additionally, most of the visual
appeal of this work is owed to {\em Fabian Dornhecker} from the {\em BamOida
Interrogang\rlap?!} The cover image was drawn by a neural network at the
Wentworth Institute of Technology.\\

Finally I want to thank my parents for always supporting and encouraging me in 
my undertakings despite this `rather aberrant choice of a career'.
